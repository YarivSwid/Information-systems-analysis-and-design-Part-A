# Information-systems-analysis-and-design
We analyzed a business we picked, and we created an informational system.
## In Part A/ "חלק א" we analyzed and reviewed the business we picked.
We choose business processes, then we reviewed the problem of the old system.
We described the system we wanted to create.
# We created 3 BPMN diagrams for 3 main processes of the company.
We thought of characterization of user requirements: we listed 30 functional requirements(6 of them are CRUDs) and 10 non functinal ones.
# We created 2 Use-Case diagrams one of the office and the other of the clients.
# We created 8 User-Interface screens to describe better how it would look like in the future.
## In Part B/ "חלק ב" we created a Class Diagram for all the CRUDs of the future system and for 6 user cases. 
we continue to work on the system :)
